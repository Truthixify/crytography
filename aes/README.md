# AES Encryption
This repo is an implementation of AES encryption purely in Rust which include supports for CBC and CTR mode.

## Notes
- The CBC mode implementation was guided by insights from Jake Purton's blog post, which provided a detailed explanation of the method.
- The CTR mode was fully designed and implemented independently.
